I was able to expand my knowledge and abilities in numerous parts of IoT development and implementation. These could include:

1. Understanding the structure and components of IoT systems, such as sensors, communication protocols, gateways, cloud platforms, and applications.

2. **Sensor Integration:** Discovering how to connect and interact with various types of sensors in order to collect data from the actual world.

3. **Embedded Systems:** Creating and programming IoT devices using microcontrollers and development boards.

4. **Communication Protocols:** Understanding various communication protocols (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, and so on) and how they are used in IoT devices.

5. **Cloud Services:** Making use of cloud platforms to store and process IoT data, as well as to set up data pipelines and analytics.

6. **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Understanding how to analyze and visualize data.
